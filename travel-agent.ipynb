    "# LangGraph Travel Agent Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a multi-agent system built with LangGraph that simulates a travel agency with specialized agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent System**: Multiple specialized agents working together\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: Framework for building stateful, multi-agent applications\n",
    "- **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities\n",
    "- **Handoff Mechanism**: Agents can transfer control to other agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervisor Agent**: Coordinates between specialized agents\n",
    "2. **Hotel Advisor Agent**: Specializes in hotel recommendations\n",
    "3. **Flights Advisor Agent**: Specializes in flight recommendations\n",
    "4. **Human Node**: Handles user interaction and routes messages\n"
